# Text classification with Deep Learning techniques

There are two main groups of ML/DL projects: classification and regression. This project will implement the first technique, specifically a binary/boolean classification of news authenticity. The dataset used can be found in the following link:

To solve this a Neural Network is implemented, with a LSTM (Long-Short term memory) layer. Furthermore, text cleaning and preprocessing techniques are applied, as well as  embeddings (vector representations for words)  using [Glove](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) .
